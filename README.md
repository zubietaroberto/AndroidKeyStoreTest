PKTest
==========

This is a simple demo of Android's KeyStore APIs, introduced in 4.2+, that enable secure storage of cryptographic keys.
Also includes a simple demo of the usage of RSA asymmetric encryption.
Much of this code was implemented from many different StackOverflow questions that I decided to compile in one spot 
for my future reference.
You are welcome to read it yourself if you need.
